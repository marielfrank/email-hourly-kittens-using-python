# email-hourly-kittens-using-python

This is my first personal project with the aim of emailing someone I love a kitten gif every hour for four hours. 

Since I'm more comfortable using Ruby, I created this program in Python to improve my skills.

The server code is written for Gmail, but you can change that up if you use another email platform.

I tested the code yesterday and all gifs went out on schedule.

I'm a newbie, so the file/coding structure isn't ideal and there are more elegant/Pythonic ways of accomplishing this.

However, I'm excited to share my first project :)

Enjoy!
